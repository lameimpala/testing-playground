    *** Coding Challenge 15

        Write a react function component called "List" that accepts
            a "list" prop, which is an array of strings.
        The List component will render an HTML <ul> element that contains HTML
            <li> elements for each string in the list.

        Examples:


        Notes:
            Although it won't cause a syntax error, make sure that each <li> element has a unique "key" prop.
            The "list" prop will always be an array.
            Nothing special needs to be done to handle an empty array
            You will need to add the appropriate arguments to the function declaration below
*/

export function List() {
    return null;
}
