/*************************
    *** Coding Challenge 13

        Write a react function component called "Name" that takes "name" 
        as a prop, and renders that prop as text

        Examples:
            <Name name="Reid" /> -> Reid
            <Name name="Tim" /> -> Tim

        Notes:
            All names will be strings, and if name is not specified, render "No name specified".
            Nothing special needs to be done to render a string, simply return it
            You will also need to add the appropriate arguments to the function declaration below
*/

export function Name() {
    return null;
}
